# How did you built the website with AI? 

I leveraged AI to generate most of the website contents and web / mobile responsiveness. Utilized ChatGPT 4o for content generation and responsiveness generation and Github Copilot for automatic code suggestion for avoiding repetitive copy / paste scenarios. 

I did encounter one issue which is related to the About section, the issue is due to how I crafted my prompt or instruction which caused the AI to give me an incorrect answer. The instruction was "Given a component named about, make sure that it has the same requirements as the Home Page but instead the image is second in grid col but first when in mobile view.". It gave an incorrect answer because I forgot or incorrectly specifiy the ordering, the expected output should be image first then the description.
